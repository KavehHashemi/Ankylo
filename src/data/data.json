    "summary": "After studying two separate fields in renowned universities, I found peace in developing websites and web-Apps. I started with ReactJs and had some experience with node.js, after that I had to learn C# Blazor, and lately, TypeScript and IndexedDB. I look forward to new challenges and new projects so I can learn new technologies and solve some problems!",
